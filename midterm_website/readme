hello professer Adee, 

I want to let you know after six youtube tutorials later I sort of figured out 
what I wanted to do, and how ot implment fully what I could do.
My javascript isn't great so sorry also my only project up there isn't the best since it was pyuthon but then I had to figure out how to make it into html
(long story I will explain in presentation)
anyways I hope you find it exceptional, my only thing is that my profile picture is basically a quirky photo of me because I don't have a professional one yet
and I really hope thats okay.

anyways I hope you enjoy
