To Katie Adee

I want to say thank you for WebDev this semester I really enjoyed it.

I know you must be stressed from grading so I am going to keep this as short as possible

first my website has a lot of break tags because the animations was annoying me, I know that isnt the best in terms of practice(at least I dont think).

second I realize that looking at my site you might wonder about the game: I have explained it more fully in the presentation and mostly the background of everything in my about page.

finnaly I wanted to say thank you (again) because I feel like I really like the front end. To be honest I am slightly more interested in the backend and react I do want to take dynamic webdev 
but I wont be able to since its at 8 am and I commute :[ 

however I will try to take it in the spring if availible I am interested and I think you can see that in my javascript simulation(which I hope I made clear)

Either way this is my website, I poured my heart into and I hope you enjoy it!
